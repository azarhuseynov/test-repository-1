    <ins><h3>The First Tournament
        The first World Cup took place in Uruguay in 1930 with the first football matches taking place on July 13th, 1930. The tournament saw France beat Mexico with the USA beating Belgium. The competition saw the hosts Uruguay knock out their great rivals Argentina in the final to become the first nation ever crowned World Cup winners.
        
        Since 1930, the competition has been held every four years except during the Second World War. The war led to a 12-year hiatus in the tournament, with it returning in 1950 in Brazil.
        
        The first World Cup saw just 13 teams compete and in 1978 the number was upped to 16. From 1982, 24 teams made it to the finals of the tournament, and this was once again increased to 32 teams in 1998. The changes aren’t done as the format of the World Cup will significantly change from 2026, when FIFA plan to have 48 teams take part. We’ll have to wait and see how this affects the competition and what other changes will be necessary.</h3></ins>
